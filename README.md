# Book-a-dev-api

This repository is a Ruby on Rails developed backend API only application named "book-a-dev-api". The purpose of the project is to automate the acquisition of technical talents by having a central location where some highly skilled developers can advertise themselves. The Application allows an authenticated user to log in to the system, get a list of all available developers who can be booked for a specified period of time and amount per hour. The developers' bio has the contact details, location, pricing per hour of the lawyer from which a user gets more insights. It also has dedicated pages to see a user's reservations and a reserve form. The project also has a Front end repository which can be viewed [here (book-a-dev-ui)](https://github.com/maxthestranger/book-a-dev-ui)


#### Project structure:
For this project, we are a team of 4 awesome members namely, [Isaka William](https://github.com/isaka-lumato), [Emmanuel Allan](https://github.com/maxthestranger), [Nicole Ciragane](https://github.com/ciraganenicole), and [Nemwel Boniface](https://github.com/Nemwel-Boniface).


To succesfully execute the project, we subdivided ourselves into two groups having Emmanuel and Nicole working on the Front End and Isaac and Nemwel working on the back end.


To do this succesfully we created a Kanban board and subdivided the tasks among ourselves and executed the tasks according to the plan that we had. The kanban can be viewed [here](https://github.com/users/maxthestranger/projects/4).


Enjoy!
